"Mr. Clean to the Rescue: Soapy Shenanigans and the Great Goo Giggler" is a comic strip that I created with my partner in CHEM 162. For this project we were tasked with converting plain text material from the course textbook and lectures, into a more visually appealing and interesting format. We decided on creating a comic about cleaning up oil spills since we could speak on the properties of liquids and how the strength of intermolecular forces allow for soap to contribute to the separation of oil from water. 

## Responsibilities

We split the research and design of the comic in half. I specialized in the research behind how the chemical attributes of soap make it useful in cleaning up oil spills. What made it difficult was understanding enough of the concept to be able to teach it in a fun way, and being able to relate it to our silly little storyline. However, as my professor explained it, when you are able to demonstrate concepts in creative ways for others it demonstrates that you have a full understanding of the topic.

## Challenges 

Within a week we were able to create an aesthetically pleasing, and entertaining short comic that hit every technical point, flowed smoothly, and most importantly expressed ingenuity. Translating these technical concepts into the comic proved to be a bit challenging. For instance, even though we all have seen the commercial where they clean oil-covered ducks with Dawn soap, there aren’t articles that describe cleaning an entire oil spill with just soap. So we had to conduct lots of research to figure out a way to create chemically sound explanations for our heroine in the comic to clean the oil spill. Additionally, my partner and I had conflicting schedules, and so we were only able to meet with each other once to discuss our ideas. Since we had different styling ideas and were unable to meet to see how to best combine our slides, we had to navigate the challenge of maintaining a cohesive visual narrative. This meant that we had to put our pride aside and be willing to give up some of the designs we thought of for the sake of cohesion.

## What was Gained

These two skills can transfer over into my professional career in computer science as well. For one, having an eye for graphic design can be extremely beneficial in web development. People will always prefer to use a cleaner, easy-to-use website over one that is all over the place, and so it is important to keep a user’s perspective whenever designing any type of platform or program. Furthermore, the ability to compromise and put egos aside for the betterment of a group product is a skill that is critical in any work environment. Collaboration is key in computer science. In order to take on large-scale problems, there is no way to avoid working with others and maintain a higher productive level. Also, whatever product is produced will reflect how well the group worked together.
