I want to be able to apply my skills learned in the course in order to design and implement a responsive web site. Instead of developing something just for the sake of learning - and for additional motivation - I want to help small business owners that I personally know.

For my test guinea pigs, I hope to work with Hakulei by Kay, Chyler's Hawaiian Beef Chips, Wedding Goals Hawaii, or Aloha on the Rocks: four local/family businesses that I've worked part time for over the past two years.

As reference, here are their current webpages:
  Hakulei by Kay: none yet
  <a href="https://chylers.com/">Chyler's Hawaiian Beef Chips</a>
  <a href="https://www.weddinggoalshawaii.com/">Wedding Goals Hawaii</a>
  <a href="https://www.alohaontherocks.com/">Aloha on the Rocks</a>

Here are some ideas for improvement that I'd like to implement:
Hakulei by Kay
 - starting from scratch
 - allow customers to make different types of orders
 - price ranges
 - display/gallery page of different kinds of leis
 - review page
 - contact list

Chyler's Hawiian Beef Chips:
 - giveaway links to the site that never work
 - fix giveaway result formats because it looks funny whenever i get them (AND MISLEADING, THE TITLE OF THE EMAIL I GOT WAS 'CONGRATULATIONS' AND I OPENED IT UP ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT I LOST)

Wedding Goals Hawaii:
 - speak with the owner, my aunt, on what things she would like to implement on her site
 - help expand the site as she spoke of adding bar and food services in the upcoming year

Aloha on the Rocks:
 - make the site more professional looking
 - images and logos on the site are either good quality or blurry, want to make it consistent
 - the formatting of the review page
 - update the information to make the site more current
