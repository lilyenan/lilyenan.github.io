<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/vacay/vacay-home-page.png">

I want to be able to apply my skills learned in the course in order to design and implement a responsive web site. 

For my test guinea pigs, I hope to work with Chyler's Hawaiian Beef Chips, Wedding Goals Hawaii, or Aloha on the Rocks: three local businesses that I've worked part time for over the past two years.

As reference, here are their current webpages:
<a href="https://github.com/jogarces/ics-313-text-game"><i class="large github icon "></i>jogarces/ics-313-text-game</a>

Chyler's Hawaiian Beef Chips: https://chylers.com/
Wedding Goals Hawaii: https://www.weddinggoalshawaii.com/
Aloha on the Rocks: https://www.alohaontherocks.com/

Here are some ideas for improvement that I'd like to implement:

Chyler's Hawiian Beef Chips:
 - giveaway links to the site that never work
 - fix giveaway result formats because it looks funny whenever i get them (AND MISLEADING, THE TITLE OF THE EMAIL I GOT WAS 'CONGRATULATIONS' AND I OPENED IT UP ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT I LOST)

Wedding Goals Hawaii:
 - speak with the owner, my aunt, on what things she would like to implement on her site
 - help expand the site as she spoke of adding bar and food services in the upcoming year

Aloha on the Rocks:
 - make the site more professional looking, it's looking a bit silly
 - images and logos on the site are either good quality or blurry, want to make it consistent
 - the formatting of the review page
 - update the information to make the site more current
