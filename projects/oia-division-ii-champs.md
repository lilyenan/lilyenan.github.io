## Serving Up Life Lessons

I was part of the girls' volleyball program during my senior year of high school. Before that season, we had been in lockdown for almost a year, which meant a gap between the skills and cohesion between the new, incoming players and the few of us who were a part of the original team two years prior. My coach pulled me aside to combat this divide and told me he relied on me to help build a bridge between all the girls. As a team sport, it is crucial to have a steady foundation of trust between teammates to support each other during high-pressure situations. Before that season, I had witnessed many times where the attitudes and drama that a team struggled with internally would show, clear as clear glass, on the court. Negative feelings lead to negative results, so it was important to me to help build unity within the team.

## ROOF: Blocking Negativity
Through this experience, I learned valuable lessons that extended beyond the volleyball court. For one, I fostered a strong enough bond within the team that we were able to make school history and win an OIA girls' volleyball title. Early on, I realized that maintaining a positive working environment and relationships brings out the best in people. It makes them feel they're no longer just working but giving their best to contribute to the team. 

Additionally, I learned that I would have to be willing to play the "bad guy" at times for the betterment of the entire team. I learned to separate being a friend to my teammates and the part of me that was tasked with leading the team. Although it was initially awkward to tell my friends to quit with their attitudes some days, I realized that confronting these problems when they first come to light makes it so that it can't marinate and blend within the team's dynamic. 

Furthermore, I experienced the influence of "leading by example." In volleyball, the goal is usually to upset the opposing team mentally; to do so, you target one player and hope they crack. What usually happens is that once one person loses confidence, the others start to feel the impact of that stress. A domino effect of losing confidence and making errors occurs. To avoid this within our team, I would continuously emphasize the importance of maintaining composure and a positive mindset. 

## Net Gains: Life Lessons Learned

As I reflect on this little project, I realize that all these skills can quickly transfer into my professional development. This experience showcased the importance of the link between positive relationships and a team's success. It also taught me that for the betterment of a team, it's crucial not to let things slide, even if your partners are your friends. Lastly, I learned that one's doubts and concerns can impact the mindset of an entire team, so it's critical to continue your actions with the active attitude of "leading by example." These lessons are some that I want to always keep in mind as I work in collaborative settings in my future endeavors.
