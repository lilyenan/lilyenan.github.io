Prior to my senior season, Leilehua High School had never won a OIA girls volleyball title. In the fall of 2021, we weren't sure of the fact that we'd have the chance to play, nevermind have a chance at winning champs for the school. Since covid had cost us the 2020 volleyball season and was still an issue in the fall of 2021, when season started we weren't even sure if there would be games to play for. We were practicing but for what? The higher ups still haven't released the game schedule or any announcement of whether or not we'd be having a season that fall. 

So when it was confirmed that we would be having a season, we rejoiced! (MAJOR YAY!)  

Ever since I moved back home in 2019, Jerry Keola had been both my high school and club coach. Always pushed me and he helped develop my confidence and mental strength on and off the court. After tryouts, he spoke to each of us individually - letting us know whether we made the cut. When it was my turn to speak with Coach, I knew I had made the team, but I didn't know I was about to get a psych consult. He called me out on the confidence, specifically the lack of, and tried to understand ..... told me he was relying on me and one of the other seniors to help guide the team. 

Because of the gap in seasons, the team was split in two. The regulars and the newbies.
