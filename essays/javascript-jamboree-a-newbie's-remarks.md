As someone who encountered some discouraging experiences while first learning to code, I always feel some slight nervousness whenever I code. That’s why the idea of learning another language, along with its syntax, tricks, and things of that nature, in such a short time was pretty daunting to contemplate. However, I’m glad to say that it wasn’t as bad of a learning curve as my anxieties made it to be. Because the logical thinking behind solving problems is still the same regardless of what language you code in, the main thing that I had to do was get used to syntax for JavaScript. One thing that I still haven’t gotten used to is the fact that in JavaScript, I don’t have to initialize any specific data types for the values or variables I implement. Specifying the data type has become ingrained to the point that it feels a little ‘illegal’ not to do so.

From a holistic point of view, I understand that my main problem, as I think many students who struggle like me can agree, is comfortability. As with anything else, you can only really know and become good at something through practice and time. This is why, even though I’m a little apprehensive about how it would affect my grade, I like the concept of athletic software engineering being used in a classroom setting. Although it can be stressful, I understand that learning in this style is what will actually turn us into competent programmers. In the real world, we’re going to have to be able to handle the pressure of the demands from our customers and bosses to produce deliverables before a hard deadline. Although it feels uncomfortable and stressful now, especially with our grades on the line, this is still the practice before the real deal. Even if we may not receive the scores that we hope to, we’re still benefiting from coding under this type of pressure and hopefully will learn to be more efficient as a result of the many WODs we will do.  

Through more experience, I hope to understand and separate the new things that I can do with JavaScript from what was unavailable or taboo in the languages I learned beforehand. Concepts that I had a hard time grasping in my ‘Introduction to Java’ class freshman year are things that I can now teach others myself. Yes, everything felt incomprehensible at first, but I can say that I really am proud of the little bits and pieces that I’ve been able to learn. It is just a matter of surrounding yourself with the uncomfortable and staying long enough for you to grow and become comfortable. With more exposure to and practice with JavaScript or any language for that matter, I feel confident that I can learn to become a more efficient and valuable asset as I move forward in my academic and professional career.
