Honestly, I never really looked at what being a software engineer encompassed before this class. Through some digging and talking with peers, I got the impression that it was a whole bunch of coding (which it is) and, therefore, something that I wasn't interested in (because of how much I suck at it). After doing some research, I concluded that while creating software solutions is a large part of what software engineers do, they are also responsible for the entire design, development, testing, and maintenance of the entire software system. 

## How I Hope to Grow

Although my specific field of interest is cybersecurity, a software engineer's skills would be instrumental in my professional development. For instance, I need to be able to look at a problem and build my software as a solution or create a tool that would help me become more efficient at my work. Developing the things I need without having to wait and rely on a team of software engineers in a company where everyone is asking them for help daily would allow me to become a valuable asset. Hopefully, with more time and practice, I can build up software engineering skills and look to be more well-rounded as a computer scientist. After all, you can never have enough skills in your pocket. The more you have, the more you can contribute.

I want to be able to apply the skills learned in the course to design and implement a responsive website. Instead of developing something just for the sake of learning - and as a little bit of additional motivation - I want to help small business owners that I know.

## Future Potential

As for my test guinea pigs, I plan to work with Hakulei by Kay and Wedding Goals Hawaii; two local businesses tied to my family that I've watched grow over the past two years.

As a reference, here are their current web pages: 
- Hakulei by Kay: none yet
- <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77830117/web-scraping-and-post-request-issue-unable-to-retrieve-expected-data">Wedding Goals Hawaii</a>

While WGH currently has a working platform, I've spoken with the owner about implementing ways in which she can monitor the orders placed more easily. Furthermore, she's spoken about a previous attempt to hire someone to fix the aesthetic of the site to her liking, just for it to be a complete waste of her time as the product was not what she had envisioned at all. Hopefully, after this class and with a little research I can assist in implementing these things.

On the other hand, my friend's business Hakulei by Kay has grown quite steadily over the past year and she's mentioned how difficult it's been for her to keep track of orders just through social media like Instagram and Facebook. To make her quality of life better, I want to create some sort of platform for her that she can reference in her social media so that all of her orders flow into one channel. This would entail starting from scratch and building a platform that can keep track of and take in various types of orders, display a gallery page of her different offers, a contact list containing her information, and a list of her pricing range. Once implemented, the goal is to make the process simple for her to use and adjust whenever she needs to.

## Conclusion

I look forward to becoming well-rounded in the field of computer science and hope to apply these skills that I learn this semester into projects that'll help me put these concepts into practice.
