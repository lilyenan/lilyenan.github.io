## These Boots Were Made for Strappin'
Initially, attempting to use Bootstrap 5 took a lot more time to understand than I care to admit. Just looking at the modules and documentation pages wasn’t enough to help me know how to use Bootstrap, and thus, it made the time it took me to figure out how to code specific assignments time-consuming. It definitely wouldn’t be wrong to state that Bootstrap was not my buddy when I first used it. However, although my initial encounter with using a User Interface (UI) framework was confusing, after just a couple of assignments, the reasons why we invested time into learning such a complicated thing made sense. 

## Store-Bought Brownie Mix > Scratch
When I was in my baking phase during covid, I thought I was good enough to graduate from pre-made mix boxes to making brownies completely from scratch. Apparently, I was wrong. In the same way that pre-made mix boxes allow you to bake without necessarily doing making it all from nothing, using a framework makes creating user interfaces much more efficient. UI frameworks standardize the process of creating user interfaces through their collections of libraries that provide pre-built, reusable elements and styling formats that are meant to be adaptable and easy for developers to use. The ease of implementation that a framework provides means that you can quickly build a webpage with all the essential components (such as a navigation bar, functional buttons, or input readers) and focus on more important things like the content of the site and making sure that it’s working as desired. 

## Go Buck-Wild
While UI frameworks help standardize the process of creating user interfaces, they don’t inhibit the creativity and uniqueness of each site. Yes, frameworks provide pre-built components and templates, but they were made with customization in mind. From colors to shapes to placement to spacing options, there are many ways in which one site made with a framework can differ from another. As I mentioned previously, because of your best friend, UI frameworks, you don’t have to worry about making these elements functional or pretty because the framework has all of that stored for you somewhere in its libraries. So, all you have to do is call on it, changing the styling of these components slightly to match your aesthetics. Zip, zap, it’s that easy!

As you can see in the comparison pictures below, the difference between using a framework and not is obvious. Frameworks, like how I used Bootstrap 5 in this example, are invaluable in the way that they accelerate the efficiency of creating a website, along with making aesthetic decisions simpler.
