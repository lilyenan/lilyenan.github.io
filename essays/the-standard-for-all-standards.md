If you’ve ever seen the show “Suits” (with pre-Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle), you’ll know that lawyers keep extensive records of all cases they’ve ever dealt with. Sometimes, cases from decades in the past get reopened, and so they have to refer to old records to build their new case. Now, imagine if all these old records were scattered over their library, and they had to waste time searching for them. Or imagine if all documents were in a folder whose thickness rivals the combination of all seven Harry Potter books, but only half of the content needed to be in there. As you can imagine, it would be an extreme pain for present lawyers to retrace and understand this case from what they have in the old case file. Implementing a standard for formatting and eliminating unnecessary content would make the transfer of this case between current and future lawyers easier. 

## The Conundrum of the Coding Kobobble
Now, forget the lawyers and imagine this in the setting of software engineers. The goal of software engineers in the workforce is to efficiently build high-quality code that can be quickly built on and maintained by other software engineers. However, this goal can prove challenging as it requires everyone to have the same techniques. Like everyone has their own “voice” when writing, you also have your own “voice” when writing code. Since everyone writes their code in the way that makes the most sense to them, something that might seem common sense to one person might be entirely foreign when shown to another. The implementation of coding standards brings us closer to this overall goal, allowing software engineers to read each other’s code efficiently. 

## Sharing is Caring
How do coding standards achieve this? For one, they set a standard for documentation. Keeping a standard for documentation isn’t necessarily needed for those working on current projects but is crucial for anyone who plans to modify the project in the future. With clear documentation, software engineers are able to understand the code as if they were the original team who had worked on it in the past. As demonstrated by our lawyer problem, if you were transferring a project between two teams (because of say, company layoffs) then in order to continue the forward momentum (p=mv #physicsbaby) of the project having a documentation of the progression of the project would make it easier to revisit and interpret in the future.

## From Typos to Ty-POSERS
Another way coding standards help software engineers build high-quality code is the ease of bug detection. Using coding standards, bugs in your code, and even formatting issues are all pointed out clearly in red, making it hard to go unnoticed. Once you fix all of the errors, you’ll notice that not only have you fixed bugs that may have prevented your code from running correctly, but it’ll also look a lot cleaner. As humans, going through code line by line and eyeballing what we think is going wrong in our code can be brutal with all the clutter. Coding standards, like ESLint, point out the easy fixes of a missing semicolon or space out everything in the same format so that we can focus on tracking the content of the code and hopefully spot what’s going on a lot easier.

## Nonnegatividads
With all these benefits, it’s hard to see why anyone could ever complain about coding standards. But you know the saying, “There’s always a way.” Just as the color red sets Bulls off into a frenzy, running ESLint and seeing fifty “errors” pop up even though your program runs as it should and produces the right product can be slightly irking. It’s kind of like, “I’ve already completed the task; why can’t I just turn in what I have? The errors are because I didn’t put a singular space between my ‘)’ and ‘{.‘” While the formatting and such may not matter for the tiny bits of code that I produce in-class assignments, on the broader scope of things, if I had a project that was thousands of lines long, the readability of my code would be a lot better for it. And in the case of the professional industry, implementing coding standards makes the shareability and malleability of software between teams a lot easier. The uniformity that coding standards bring far outweighs the minor inconveniences someone might complain about, as it brings us closer to our primary goal of efficiently building high-quality code that can quickly be built on and maintained by other software engineers.
